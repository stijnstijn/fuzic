What is Fuzic?
---

Fuzic is a site that keeps statistics and viewer numbers for live streams (on [many](/faq/) providers) that broadcast people playing video games. It keeps track of how many people are watching these streams and at what times they are broadcasting, and uses these numbers to calculate rankings on, for example, which player has had the most viewers during the past week.

Statistics are kept for the following games: StarCraft 2, StarCraft: Brood War, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch. For more information, see the [FAQ](/faq/). For further questions, see the [contact](/contact/) page.

Thank yous
