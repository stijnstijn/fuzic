Managing your stream's events on Fuzic
---
Streamed events are currently automatically tracked via the [TeamLiquid event calendar](http://www.teamliquid.net/calendar/). If you run a stream and host events that you cannot submit to the calendar (for example, because they don't fit TeamLiquid's criteria), you can request a Streamer Account.

With an account you can manually add events run by your stream. Further functionality may be added later. You can request an account if:

- Your stream is tracked by Fuzic
- Your stream is "notable"; notable streams are denoted by a star in stream listings and in the lower left corner of a stream's picture on its page.
- *Or* your stream has over 50,000 recorded Viewer Hours (V&times;H). Your V&times;H count is listed in the fourth column at the top of your stream's page.

To request an account, send an e-mail to [accounts@fuzic.nl](mailto:accounts@fuzic.nl) with a link to your Fuzic stream page and a short description of the type of events you would want to add manually.
